Word Cloud analysis of a news article

Overview:
For this task, I selected an article from https://news.err.ee and saved its content into a text file ("article.txt"). The goal was to visualize the most frequent words in the article using Python.

Methodology:
- I read the article text from "article.txt" in Python.
- Using the "WordCloud" library, I generated a word cloud.
- Common stopwords (like "and", "the", "to") were removed to highlight meaningful words.
- The word cloud image ("wordcloud.png") visually represents the key topics and themes of the article.

Results:
The resulting word cloud clearly shows which words appear most frequently in the article, giving a quick visual summary of the content.

Files included:
- "article.txt" — the original article text used for analysis  
- "wordcloud.ipynb" — the Python code used to generate the word cloud  
- "wordcloud.png"— the resulting word cloud image  

Interpretation
The word cloud makes it easy to identify the main topics discussed in the article. Larger words indicate higher frequency, providing an at-a-glance understanding of the article's key points.
